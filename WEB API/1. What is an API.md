### **Key Concepts Summary: Request & Response Cycle in Web APIs**  

1. **Request & Response Cycle**  
   - Fundamental to API interactions.  
   - **Request:** The client (e.g., web browser) asks for data.  
   - **Response:** The server sends back the requested data.  

2. **HTTP Methods (Verbs)**  
   - **GET:** Retrieve data from the server (most common for APIs).  
   - **POST:** Add new data.  
   - **PUT:** Update existing data.  
   - **DELETE:** Remove data.  
   - (Other verbs exist, but these are the core ones.)  

3. **Client-Server Communication**  
   - **Client:** Your browser or application making requests.  
   - **Server:** Processes the request and sends a response.  

4. **Successful Request**  
   - If the request is properly formatted, the response includes the expected data.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
APIs rely on HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to enable communication between clients and servers, with GET being the most common for retrieving data.
